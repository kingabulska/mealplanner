<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Let's start with something simple. Write a program that can save a meal and its properties. Prompt the user about the meal category (breakfast, lunch, or dinner), its name, and the necessary ingredients. The program should save that information and be able to print the saved meal with all its properties in the correct format.</p>

<h2><strong>Objectives</strong></h2>

<p>In this stage, your program should:</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Ask the user about the meal category with the following message: <code class="java">Which meal do you want to add (breakfast, lunch, dinner)?</code>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Save the category and ask about the name of the meal with the message <code class="java">Meal's name:</code>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Save the meal's name and then ask about the necessary ingredients with the message <code class="java">Ingredients:</code>. The ingredients should be listed in one line separated by commas.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Save the ingredients and print all the information about the meal in the following format:</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<pre><code class="java">Category: category
Name: meal's name
Ingredients:
ingredient 1
ingredient 2
etc.</code></pre>

<p>5. Print the message that the meal was successfully saved: <code class="java">Meal added!</code>.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
