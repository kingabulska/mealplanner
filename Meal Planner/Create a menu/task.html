<h2>Description</h2>

<p>One meal is not going to get you far. Let's create a menu that allows the user to add several meals and show them together with their properties. For this, we need to add a few commands.</p>

<ul>
    <li>The command <code class="java">add</code> should start the meal input process and prompt the user for the meal's properties.</li>
    <li>The command <code class="java">show</code> should print the list of all the saved meals with their names, categories, and ingredients.</li>
    <li>After executing <code class="java">add</code> or <code class="java">show</code>, the program should ask the user about the next action.</li>
    <li>The program should run until the user inputs <code class="java">exit</code>, which terminates the program.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this stage, your program should also check the user input: what if the user entered something wrong? </p>

<ul>
    <li>If the input meal category is something other than breakfast, lunch, or dinner, print <code class="java">Wrong meal category! Choose from: breakfast, lunch, dinner.</code> </li>
    <li>If the meal's name or ingredients have the wrong format (for example, if they contain numbers), print <code class="java">Wrong format. Use letters only!</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Make an infinite loop that can only be terminated with the <code class="java">exit</code> command.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The program should prompt the user to choose the action with the message <code class="java">What would you like to do (add, show, exit)?</code></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>After the command has been processed, the user should be prompted for another action.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Make sure that the input and output format is correct.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>If the user asks the program to <code class="java">show</code> meals before any were added, print <code class="java">No meals saved. Add a meal first.</code></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>After the <code class="java">exit</code> command, print <code class="java">Bye!</code> and end the program.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
