<h2>Description</h2>

<p>A good planner plans for the week ahead! Let's help our users plan their meals for the entire week. For this, we will add a command <code class="java">plan</code> to our menu. The program should print the first day of week – Monday –  and then print the list of all breakfast meals stored in the database in alphabetical order. Then, the program should prompt the user to pick a meal option with the message <code class="java">Choose breakfast for Monday from the list above:</code>. </p>

<p>After the user provided a name, the program should verify it. If the database does not contain the meal with such a name, print <code class="java">This meal doesn’t exist. Choose a meal from the list above.</code>. If the user input is correct, move on to the next category – lunch – and then to dinner. After the user has picked the meal options for all three categories, print <code class="java">Yeah! We planned the meals for Monday.</code>.</p>

<p>Repeat these steps for the rest of the days all the way through Sunday. In the end, print the whole weekly plan.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>1. Insert an empty line after one day's meals have been planed.</p>

<p>2. The format should be as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Monday
Breakfast: &lt;meal's name&gt;
Lunch: &lt;meal's name&gt;
Dinner: &lt;meal's name&gt;

Tuesday etc.</code></pre>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>

<p>Note: the example below assumes that the database already has quite a few meals stored.</p>
